Description:
  As I noted in the CSS comments, this website design/style was largely inspired by the video
  I linked under my sources. The navigation and the region directly under it are stylistically
  drawn from that video. The rest of the site, other than the footer, are more so my twist on
  things. I probably spent close to 10 hours total on this assignment.
